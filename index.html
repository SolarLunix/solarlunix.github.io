						<p>Hello everyone, Melissa here, I've taken the time to create this website as a portfolio to display my skills and keep my projects all together. It is my hope that while it is a portfolio page that everyone who lands here will find something that they enjoy doing.</p>

						<p>As this is a portfolio of the work that I enjoy doing, there are actually a lot of different things you'll find on this website. As I expand my page, you'll be able to find examples of just about everything I do. Some of my favourite topics are: research, coding, writing, drawing, and photography, just to name a few. Even the jumbotron is an image that I took myself during the super moon. You are welcomed to take a look at <a href="CV.html">my full cv</a>, while some information is taken out for privacy (such as my home address and phone number) you are welcomed to email me and I will reply as soon as possible.</p>

						<p>Below this panel you'll find descriptions of what some of the other pages on this page are about. Of course, you're welcomed to just go and check out each page without reading about them. Personally, I recomend taking some time and heading over to the Games page.</p>

						<p>This website is typically a work in progress, if you find something that isn't working, please send me an email at solarlunix@gmail.com and I'll be sure to get it fixed quickly for you! Thanks so much for visiting my website</p>
