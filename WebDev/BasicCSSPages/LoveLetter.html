	<div>Dearest Husband,
		<p>You may not realise this, but you are quite an inspiration for me. When we met I was in such a dark place and today I can truly say that I am happy.</p>
		<p>I just want to remind you that you are an amazing computer scientist. You have brought my ability to program from absolute nothing to nearly your level in the matter of a few months. I know you have trouble with the mathematics, but we will go through it together and I assure you that you will be one of the best programmers ever.</p>
		<p>Sweetheart, you are absolutely amazing. I know you can do this, and I know that you're going to be amazing when you go on for your master's and your PhD. I look forward to following in your footsteps then and getting my own PhD in Computer Science, as well as one in Biology (because I honestly don't like leaving work unfinished).</p>
		<p>Thank you for being by my side through everything. You've taught me so much, and look at what I made thanks to you reminding me to work on my web development.</p>
		<p>While I didn't use every trick that I learned, I used a lot of them, and especially the newest ones. I hope you like what I was able to do. Thank you for the push and the drive to do all of this.</p>
		<p class="sig">Your Bunny</p>
