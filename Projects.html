							This game is a short text adventure about you on a summer's eve, drinking beer in your car while driving down a long empty highway.

						<p>	<strong>About:</strong><br>
							This handy little colour picker helps you create values on your computer and gives you several outputs based on the colour that you create including rgb, rgba, and hexidecimal. It even includes a grayscale option. It currently needs to be downloaded and used on Visual Studio, but a link with the full working program will be added in the future after a few non-functional requirements are met. It does work well in its current state, so if you want you can dowload it from my github. Simply click on the code link to go to the project's page.

							This java game can either be played in console or on an IDE such as Eclipse. It allows you to generate madlibs based on a list. It is in working order, however, there are tweaks that could be done to make it better, and if I have time I will return to the project in the future to make these changes.

							DevOps Class Project 1 was a multi-element project. To be functional, the following elements were required:
							<ul>
								<li>Create a user</li>
								<li>Read the size of a directory</li>
								<li>Back up a directory</li>
								<li>Order a virtual machine, or more than one</li>
								<li>Start a server and display the ordered virtual machine</li>

							This game picker will help you choose a game when you don't know what to do. All you have to do is add all your games in and the systems they're for. Add custom tags for even better suggestions.

							The Date Calculator will allow you to easily find the difference between two days. It is Java code and can work from the console or from an IDE like Eclipse. 
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many websites and libraries that use the same functionality and have a higher accuracy since they can include hours, minutes, and even seconds. As this was just an exercise I feel there is no reason to continue to develop this project.

						<p>	<strong>About:</strong><br>
							Pizza Toppings was made in Java as an exercise. The user is to have people come and type the pizza toppings they want one at a time hitting enter between each topping they want. When everyone has entered their toppings a list would print saying how many people wanted each type of topping. It was a thought of making ordering pizza easier at a party, although it isn't very practical. Therefore it has been abandoned, although it does its function.
