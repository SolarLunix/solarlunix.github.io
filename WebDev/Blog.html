		<h2>The First Article</h2>
		<p>This blog was created as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp as part of <a href="http://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>'s many courses. I find the course to go at a good pace, and the instructor really takes his time to explain every part of a solution. It can feel a little slow if you know what you're doing, however, I prefer a teacher who moves a little slower because it means that those who are not as fast as I am don't get left behind.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in learning how to create your own page, you should consider taking <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Development Bootcamp</a> course!</p>
		<p>Happy learning!</p>
